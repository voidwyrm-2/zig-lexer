# Zig Lexer
A lexer written in Zig

**Usage:**
1. Install Zig if you don't have it(you can use `zig version` to check, if it doesn't print `x.xx.x`, you don't have it)
    > To install it, you can either get it from [the website](https://ziglang.org), or download it with a package manager(MacOS: `brew install zig`, Windows: `choco install zig`, Linux: `you know what you're doing`)
2. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/voidwyrm-2/zig-lexer`
3. Cd into the `zig-lexer` folder
4. Run either `zig run main.zig` or `zig build-exe main.zig` and `./main`(`.\main.exe` on Windows)
